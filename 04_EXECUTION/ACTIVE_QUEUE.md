**Verified against:** `origin/main = 52e3ea3` (2026-10-03 21:05 UTC, incoming strategic window). GitHub PR/CI state and the MLB Stats API checked live.
VPS facts are the 50.2 cleanup terminal's report, not re-verified from here (this window has no SSH).

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Highest GG / T / ADR / EXP | **GG-450** registered (GG-443..449 claimed, unused) · **T-653** claimed · **ADR-0070** (PROPOSED) · **EXP-037** · gap log 178 OPEN |
| Registry (92 cells) | ACTIVE 1 · **SHADOW 7** (MLB player-hits T1-T3 + NFL T1 moneyline / spread / total / team total, flipped 2026-10-03 by T-608) · BLOCKED 2 · DARK 1 · NOT_IMPLEMENTED 81 |
| Capital | **$0.** `kelly_fraction = 0.0` on every operating band. Demo venue only. SHADOW = evaluate and log. |
| NFL + MLB postseason shadow | **Armed** (50.2): EXP-037 cron block installed; crontab backup `/root/crontab.bak.20261003T200240Z`; first NFL T1 firing 2026-10-04 00:05 UTC. |
| NHL | Flying in shadow: 9 cells have rows (51.3). Registry still says NOT_IMPLEMENTED. Never uses the confirmed goalie (GG-401). Team-code parser unverified (GG-403). |
| PR #157 (50.1 process fixes) | **NOT mergeable again** (GitHub `dirty`, 21:05 UTC): main moved 13 commits after 51.3; the only conflict is `11_MEMORY_HANDOFF/OPERATOR_DIGEST_20261003.md`, a `merge=union` file GitHub can't auto-merge. CI green on head `42a0d0d`. Landing block re-merges main into it first. |
| 51.1 / 51.2 branches | **No CI run on either** (branches only get CI as PRs). 51.2's final full-suite rerun was not confirmed at close-out. 51.2 also conflicts with main on 4 nav files (DECISION_LOG, PLAN, TODO_NEXT, MEMORY_BANK). 51.1 merges clean. |
| VPS | HEAD `eb2d1434` (50.2). `pmbot-web-dashboard` process still on `077558b`. |
| Deploy | **Every push to main that touches anything outside the 9 doc folders auto-deploys and restarts `t4-mlb` + `pmbot-web-dashboard`** (`deploy.yml`, GG-432). A push is docs-only only if EVERY file in it is under `00_ADMIN 01_SPEC 02_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN 03_DECISIONS 04_EXECUTION 05_RESEARCH_EXPERIMENTS 07_TEST_VALIDATION_EVIDENCE 08_MODEL_RISK_GOVERNANCE 11_MEMORY_HANDOFF`. |
| Live games today (Stats API, 21:00 UTC) | CWS@CLE final · **ATL@LAD in progress** · NYY@TB 22:30Z · SD@MIL 00:30Z (5:30 PM PT). **Earliest code-push window: after SD@MIL goes Final, ~03:30 UTC = ~8:30 PM PT.** Tomorrow's first pitch SD@MIL 20:00Z. |

## ⬛ NOW — Wave 51

| Block | Status | Result / next |
|---|---|---|
| **51.1** Kill-switch truth | ⚠️ **DONE** — fix on a branch, not live | Kill switch **not tripped**: realized drawdown 10.60%. Dashboard's 26.63% wrongly counted $160 of stake in 17 positions open since Aug 6. Follow-up: Kalshi **cancelled 16 of the 17**, so realized after booking is ~11–12%, under 20% (GG-441, GG-450). MLB resolver is dark — statsapi 406s from the VPS (GG-440). Dashboard fix on branch `6cbe62f`. |
| **51.2** NHL silent drops | ⚠️ **DONE** — fix on a branch, not live | NHL markets for SJ / TB / LA / NJ (2-letter Kalshi codes) were being silently dropped. Fixed + abstention counters on branch `f822b6b`. GG-403 partial; follow-up T-647. |
| **51.3** PR #157 merge-ready | ✅ **DONE** — but stale | Was MERGEABLE at 20:34 UTC (head `42a0d0d`, CI green). Main has since moved; GitHub shows `dirty` again (one union-file conflict). 9 NHL cells have rows (T1, T2, T3 × moneyline, puck line, total). |

**Nothing to paste right now.** New strategic window took over 2026-10-03 ~2:05 PM PT. Next block is the **landing block** (merge #157, 51.1's dashboard fix, 51.2's branch; flip the 9 NHL cells to SHADOW). It needs no MLB game live — earliest **~8:30 PM PT**. It goes here when that window opens, not before.

The three Wave 51 prompts are in `ACTIVE_QUEUE_ARCHIVE.md` (51.2's while it runs).

## ⬛ OPERATOR DIRECTIVE, 2026-10-02 17:03 PT — TIME-BOUNDED BLOCKS

> *"We added so many extra tasks to the windows that it was about to take over 2+ hours for each window to
> complete so I cut it short each way. I'm not letting windows run for hours on end — if there's a task that'll
> take that long, don't place it."*

> And minutes later, when a wave was first sized at ~75 minutes a block: *"Even 75 minutes is way too long —
> none of these tasks better take 75 minutes."*

**Every block is sized at about 30 minutes, hard stop at 45** — at the nearest pushed boundary, with a handoff
that names where the next session resumes. Scope is cut to fit the clock, never the reverse: one job per block,
done completely. Budget includes the one full test-suite run (~11 minutes) a block landing `src/` code needs.

**What does not belong in a window:** anything whose wall time is set by waiting rather than working. Those run
unattended on the VPS under their own authorization, and a later block reads what they produced.

---

## ⬛ WHAT 50.2 FOUND (and what this window found checking it)

- **NFL + MLB postseason shadow crons are armed.** The 33 pre-game cells now log unattended. Nothing restarted.
- **Who restarted t4-mlb: CI.** `deploy.yml` restarts `t4-mlb` and the dashboard on every code push to main (GG-432).
  That contradicts the standing "never restart t4-mlb" rule; the policy is yours (Needs your decision, first row).
- **The dashboard's stale panel and its 26.63% drawdown are one file** (strategic window, arithmetic):
  `paper_portfolio_mlb.json`, last written 2026-08-06 00:05Z (+58d20h = the panel's "read 58d20h ago", GG-431);
  $733.75 of $1,000 = 26.63%, past the 20% permanent kill switch.
- **The two drawdowns are not the same quantity** (strategic window, code read — 51.1 verifies): the T1 runner feeds
  the kill switch *realized* loss only (`run_mlb_paper_trade.py:670-671`); the dashboard shows
  `(initial − bankroll) / initial` (`web_dashboard.py:761`, `:1498`), which also counts stake locked in ~17 positions
  open since August. So the tile may be alarming on money that is tied up, not lost — or the kill switch may have
  missed a real breach. No capital either way (kelly 0.0).
- **PR #157 is not mergeable as it stands** (GitHub: `mergeable_state = dirty`) — 50.2's report did not say so. 51.3 makes it mergeable; it lands in a later idle window.

---

## Read this first (standing)

- **Three blocks per wave. Not four.** Operator directive 2026-09-15.
- **Every block: ~30 minutes, hard stop at 45.** One job per block, done completely. Waiting is not work.
- **Deliverable 0 in every block: confirm your base** (`git fetch`; work from current `origin/main`).
- **Claim IDs at run time and re-verify after ANY release or retry** (GG-322). Never "TBD".
- **A premise written in a block is a claim to verify, not a fact.** Including every number in this file.
- **Never bypass, disable, or work around a permission control.** Record the exact command and refusal text, then hand back.
- **Pre-register before scoring.** Frozen pre-registrations stay frozen. No scoring before a cell's judged n.
- **SHADOW means evaluate and log.** No order, position, paper fill, stake or `kelly_fraction` change.
- **A merge is a deployment here, and a code deployment restarts `t4-mlb`** (deploy.yml, GG-432). Until the operator
  decides GG-432: code reaches main only when no MLB game is live (Stats API shows none In Progress, T4 cycle log idle
  > 15 min, no first pitch within 60 min). Docs-only pushes are always fine.
- **Paper and shadow work is plumbing** (operator's standing framing). Real capital is his.
- **The Live Terminal and the project view move with the bot.** A block that adds a cell, ledger, source or verdict makes it visible.
- Register-and-stop on any gap outside scope (Hard Rule 11).

## THE ARC — renumbered (49-50 went to landing and cleanup)

| Wave | The question it answers |
|---|---|
| **51** | *Is what the operator sees true, and is everything built actually landed?* Kill switch vs dashboard; NHL silent drops; #157 made mergeable. |
| **52** | **NHL scoring readiness** — confirmed-goalie source at T3 (GG-401), pre-registered spread cutoff (GG-404), clustered scorer (GG-407), matinee coverage (GG-405). **NBA (opens 10-20)** in ~30-minute blocks. Merge whatever 51 left on branches. |
| **53** | First looks as cells reach judged n (NFL first: 60 games ≈ late October). A **flat-stake paper ADR** for SHADOW cells — yours to accept. |
| **later** | In-play arms only where C5 / ADR-0068 shows speed is measured. Sizing only for a cell that cleared its gate and its capacity question. |

What should reorder this, and what should stop it:

- **A shadow path that reaches an order, position or sizing function** stops everything shadow until fixed.
- **A dashboard that shows a number it did not read live, or a number that is not what its label says** is a defect of the same severity.
- **A kill switch that should have fired and did not** (51.1 verdict c) stops everything until understood.
- **Per cell, the pre-registered rules decide.** RULED_OUT at judged n is a completed cell.
- **Board-survey stop condition — pre-registered in Wave 45, carried unchanged.**

---

## Queued next — not yet fired

**Landing block** — issued only when no MLB game is live (earliest about 8:30 PM PT tonight): merge #157, flip NHL's cells with rows to SHADOW, merge 51.1/51.2's green branches; idle probe and Deploy checks on each. **NHL scoring readiness** (GG-401, GG-404, GG-405, GG-407) — before any NHL score is read. **NBA game markets.** **The board
survey** (after the history store completes — needs the detached-VPS-jobs line). **MLB winter disposition** after the World
Series. **Step 4 season-awareness** (GG-343..345). **PIPE-08 406s.** **T4M-PROJ and T3 disposition** (both MISFILED). **The
branch estate** (33+ unmerged). **Aged open paper positions** (9 T4, ~17 T1 — 51.1 reports on the T1 set). **Test-suite runtime.**

---

## Needs your decision

**Nothing in Wave 51 is gated on a line here.**

> **AUTHORIZATION — SHADOW-EVALUATION CRON JOBS (operator, 2026-10-02 15:22 PT: "Yes permission granted").** Unchanged;
> used by 50.2. Not covered: any order, position, fill, stake or `kelly_fraction` change; any EXISTING cron line.

> **AUTHORIZATION — LIVE TERMINAL DEPLOY AND RESTART (operator, 2026-10-02 15:44 PT).** Standing. Covers
> `pmbot-web-dashboard` only. Note: under today's `deploy.yml`, any code merge also restarts `t4-mlb` — see GG-432 below.

| Item | Plain English | What it costs while it waits |
|---|---|---|
| **NEW — GG-432: CI restarts t4-mlb on every code push** | Today every merge that touches code restarts the live T4 process, including mid-game. Options: (a) **window's recommendation** — deploy pulls code on every push but skips the `t4-mlb` restart while an MLB game is live (it restarts at the next idle window); (b) never auto-restart `t4-mlb`, restart only by hand; (c) keep as is. | Every code landing waits for an idle window by hand, as Wave 51 does. |
| **Detached read-only VPS jobs** | Long read-only work runs unattended on the VPS through `scripts/vps_job.py`. A line naming *detached read-only VPS jobs* unlocks it. | The board survey and NFL/NHL market backtests stay blocked. |
| **T1 MLB postseason flag** | Adds `--include-postseason` to the existing T1 MLB cron line. Edits an existing line, so the shadow authorization does not cover it. | T1 player-hits stays blind for the rest of the playoffs. |
| **EXP-034** | Run its ≥2.5-hour sampler as a VPS job, or **park** it (window's recommendation). | Nothing urgent. |
| **ADR-0070** | Model-class deviation for NFL/MLB shadow models. **As written it does not cover NHL** (GG-400): widen it while still PROPOSED, or accept that GG-400 stays open. | Nothing until the flat-stake question. |
| **GG-347, remaining half** | The SSH poller from 73.231.159.158 — yours? | An unexplained actor on the VPS. |
| **MLB winter** | After the World Series: stand T1/T4 MLB down, or idle all winter? | Daily false alarms in Step 4 until spring. |
| **Settlement + depth capture schedules · Polymarket KYC · odds feed · provenance allowlist · APR-0035 · ADR-0068 · ADR-0067 · 39.3 triage · ADR-0063/0064/0065/0066 · APR-0034/0036** | Unchanged. | — |

## DO NOT — standing

- **Never bypass, disable, or work around a permission control.** Record the exact command and the exact refusal text, then hand back. An approval authorizes a CHANGE, never a bypass.
- **Submit no order against the production Kalshi account or with real funds. Demo only, always.**
- Touch sizing or any `kelly_fraction` without an ADR, including T1.
- Push code to main while an MLB game is live (until GG-432 is decided).
- Promote `assert_ledger_invariants.py` to `--strict`.
- Repair or backfill a DERIVED field without establishing provenance first (GG-228).
- Land red work to clear a backlog.
- Relabel a pre-registered verdict, or change a pre-registered parameter, after seeing results.
- Recommend against a sport, band or market family on one finding.
- Modify or re-time an existing price-capture window. Additive sibling writers only.
- Rotate, truncate or clear a VPS log or journal.
- Restart a production service without a scoped, written authorization. Do not hand-pull on the VPS.
- Add or edit a cron entry without explicit operator authorization.
- Pre-assign T-/GG-/ADR- numbers. Claim at run time; verify uniqueness across `git log --all`.
- Report a live fix RESOLVED without proving the RUNNING process contains it.
- Manufacture a position, a row, a cohort member, a price, a fill, or a final score.
- Delete, truncate or rewrite a live pool file. Work on copies.
- Weaken a predicate, or widen an allowlist without citation, to raise a count.
- Modify `p_hits_gte_threshold` — 1,694 rows' provenance citation rests on its source hash.
